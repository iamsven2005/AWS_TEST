    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3. **Configure Environment Variables**

    - Rename .env.example to .env and fill in the required values.
    - Ensure all necessary environment variables are set, including:
        - DATABASE_URL: Your Prisma database connection string.
        - JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT signing.
        - OPENAI_API_KEY: API key for OpenAI services.
        - EMAIL_SERVER_HOST, EMAIL_SERVER_PORT, EMAIL_SERVER_USER, EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD: Credentials for Nodemailer.
        - EMAIL_FROM: The sender email address for outgoing emails.

4. **Run Database Migrations and Seed Data**

    ```bash
    pnpm gen
    pnpm push
    pnpm seed
    ```

    - pnpm gen: Generates the Prisma client.
    - pnpm push: Applies database migrations.
    - pnpm seed: Seeds the database with initial data.

5. **Start Prisma Studio**

    Access Prisma Studio for database management and inspection.
    ```
    pnpm stu
    ```

    Open http://localhost:5555 in your browser to access Prisma Studio.

6. **Start the Development Server**
    ```
    pnpm dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js development server on http://localhost:3000.

7. **Access the Application**

    Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to use the application.
